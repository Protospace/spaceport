## Membership

### After how long after not paying do our cards deactivate?

3 months after a member's expiry date they become "Expired" and their cards deactivate. See [Membership Accounting](Membership%20Accounting.md) for more info.

Technically this could be 4+ months after the last payment was made since membership is paid ahead of time. For example if I paid for 1 month today, my cards would deactivate in 4 months from today.

### Can Spaceport bill members or refuse payments via PayPal?

No, Spaceport is only notified when a payment has occurred. It's unable to request or refuse payments from members. It's also unable to manage payment subscriptions. See [PayPal Integration](PayPal%20Integration.md) for more info.
