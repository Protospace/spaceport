Your Protospace Account is the one you registered when you signed up for a Protospace membership.

The username has the format: **firstname.lastname**

You will use this account to log into the [[The Portal|portal]], the [[The Forums|forums]], the WIki, and all the Protospace computers.

It's recommended that you use a password you can type into the Protospace computers without needing a password manager.

If you forget your username or password, visit the portal at <https://my.protospace.ca> and do a password reset to your email. If you forget which email you used, contact a [[Directors|Director]].
