Directors are elected volunteers responsible for Protospace meeting its legal obligations. They also manage Protospace's bills and finances. If you have any dues related issues, bring it up with one of them. Occasionally Directors handle private issues affecting specific members. Otherwise, they have no more significance, power or leadership than any other voting member.

The directors can be contacted by emailing:  
<directors@protospace.ca>
