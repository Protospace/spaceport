Protospace hosts a monthly clean on the third Saturday of every month at 10:00 AM.

Attending a clean is a great way to meet other Protospace members and help out. It's also an opportunity for new members to get [[Sponsorship|sponsors]]. Free lunch is provided to all those who clean.

Since we have no staff or employees, we clean Protospace ourselves.
