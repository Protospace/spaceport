Parking tickets are issued to items that were stored without a [[Pitches and Motions|pitch or motion]].

Anyone can issue a parking ticket by getting one from the [[Principal's Office]], filling it out, signing it, and attaching it to the item.

After two weeks of going unaddressed, the offending item may be thrown out by any member or at a monthly clean.

If the parking ticket isn't filled out correctly or is invalid, it may be removed. If you issue or remove a ticket, it's best to take a picture so you have a record.
