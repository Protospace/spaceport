The "DMZ", also known as the "No Fly Zone", is the back of the wood shop starting at the garage door and ending at the yellow line on the ground.

Nothing is supposed to be stored in the DMZ. It's meant to be used as a space to work on projects or vehicles. If you need to have something there overnight, make a [[Pitches and Motions|pitch]] for it on the forums.

The name stands for [Demilitarized Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demilitarized_zone).
