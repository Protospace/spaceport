To stop your membership, simply email <directors@protospace.ca> and ask to have your membership stopped. It would be great if you explained why, but this is completely optional. It may help us grow better as a community.

If you have an ongoing PayPal subscription, you'll need to log into your PayPal account and cancel it. If you have a member shelf, please make sure to clear it. You are always welcome to come hang out during a [[Tuesday Open House]].

When stopped, your membership will be considered paused and you'll be able to return for up to a year. After 12 months have passed, you'll no longer be considered a member and will need to re-apply and get [[Vetting|vetted]] again.
