Welcome, new member! Joining Protospace can be quite the process, so this guide book was written to explain each of the steps.

This page summarizes the steps that you'll need to follow to become a full member and some useful things to know. Most things mentioned have their own pages that you'll come across as you read this guide. In order to not be overwhelming, they won't be linked to from this page.

## Membership Process

This is a rough list of things you'll need to do:

- sign up
- pay your member dues
- visit Protospace in order to meet people
- attend a New Member Orientation
- get two members to sponsor (vouch for) you
- attend classes on things that interest you
- after four weeks, get vetted to become a full member
- get a card / fob for 24/7 access
- get a member shelf
- build cool things
- help improve Protospace

## Building Cool Things

In order to use any tool larger than a screwdriver, you'll need to attend the New Member Orientation class. You can sign up for one on the portal (explained below).

If there's a machine you want to use for your project, it may require attending a class to operate. Hand tools generally don't require training, while large stationary machines do. There's usually a QR code on machines that link to a page explaining what kind of training is required. If you already have training on the specific machine, we generally require you take the class anyway for liability reasons. Some instructors allow students to "challenge" the class and skip it though.

Some machines (like the laser cutters) require that you become vetted before you are given free reign on the machine. Access may be controlled by computer login or tapping your member card to activate the machine.

Protospace stocks lots of materials that you are welcome to use. If you use something of value, it's expected that you'll contribute back to Protospace something of equal or greater value. You also can't hoard things, only take something if you have an immediate use for it.

## Attending Classes

Right away you should sign up to attend the New Member Orientation class here:

You can view a list of all upcoming classes here:

Our instructors are all members like you that volunteer their time to teach classes. If you sign up for a class, it's important that you attend so you aren't wasting their volunteer effort or taking a slot from someone else.

## Communication

We mostly use "the forums" to communicate here:  
<https://forum.protospace.ca>

You can log in with the same account that you signed up with. The username is usually **firstname.lastname**. If you forgot it, look at the welcome email you got sent.

If you have any questions or problems, you can email Protospace here:  
<info@protospace.ca>

## Visiting Protospace

In order to progress, you'll actually have to go to Protospace.
