If you are the last person to leave Protospace, you'll need to close and secure the building.

If you are the second-to-last person to leave, you should tell the last person so they know to lock up when they decide to leave.

To lock up, follow these steps:

- ensure no one else is in the building
	- be sure to check the [[The Useless Room|electronics room]] and [[Incubation Room]]
- ensure all doors are closed and locked:
	- welcome room door latched
	- server room door latched
	- wood shop back door dead-bolted
	- metal shop back door latched
- ensure the two bay garage doors have their chains secured
- turn off the lights
- set the alarm

Tips:

- physically press on the latching doors to make sure they are secure
- if the welcome room door doesn't latch, make sure the red button on the desk is off
- the metal shop lights are three-way, there's a switch by the back door
- a path you can follow is:
	- classroom (check the [[Principal's Office]])
	- stairwell (check server room door)
	- kitchen (check electronics room / bathrooms)
	- steampunk lounge (check incubation room)
	- welcome room (check door)
	- wood shop (check back door, bay door)
	- metal shop (check bay door)

## Alarm

To set the alarm it needs to be "ready", which requires all the doors to be secure and no motion. Then simply type in the alarm code, nothing else.

To disarm the alarm, type in the alarm code.

If you forget the alarm code, refer to the Portal > Member > [Cards / Access](https://my.protospace.ca/cards) page (full members only).
