Protospace members use membership cards or fobs to gain 24/7 access to the building. You'll recieve your own member card after you get [[Vetting|vetted]].

If you ever lose your membership card or key fob, it can be recreated in the [[Principal's Office]]. Please contact a [[Directors|Director]] (or a Portal Admin).

If you find a lost membership card, please inform a [[Directors|Director]]. You can determine who owns it by scanning at the vending machine.
