Member hosting is one way probationary members can visit Protospace before they are [[Vetting|vetted]]. It's when a full member offers to be at the space so that a probationary member can visit.

## Being Hosted

You can check if someone has offered to host members on the [[The Portal|portal]]. New members can see the hosting status at the top of the page. For example, it might say "Open until 5:30 pm" which means a member has offered to host until 5:30 pm.

If the space is open, you can simply head there and ring the doorbell until someone (probably the host) lets you in. You should ask for the host and let them know you've arrived. You are welcome to be at the space until the closing time, or someone else offers to host later.

If you'd like to plan a time to be hosted in the future, you are welcome to ask in the "Find a Host" category on the forums:

If you've been hosted, it would be nice if you could pay it forward and host other members once you get vetted.

## Hosting Others

If you arrive at the space and are willing to host new members while you are there, press a button on the host box near the lasers. The space will be considered "open" and probationary members will be able to see on the portal. If the host box's buttons aren't flashing, just scan your card outside and come back to it.

While hosting, your responsibilities are:

- listen for the doorbell so you can let new members in
	- this is especially important in the winter
- make sure they don't set the place on fire
- give a 10 minute warning when you need to leave

If you'd like to schedule a time to host new members in the future, please post your availability in the "Find a Host" category on the forums:
