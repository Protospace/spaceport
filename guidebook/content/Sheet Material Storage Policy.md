Sheet materials are difficult to transport, so we have a rack at Protospace that's dedicated to storing them and random pieces of useful wood.

The unofficial policy is:

> Materials must be labelled with:
> 
> - Name
> - Contact Info
> - Date newer than 3 months ago
> 
> Stealing is unexcellent, except:
> 
> - Missing Info? Free for all.
> - Illegible label? Help yourself.
> - Older than 3 months? Fair game.

You can use Protovac's printer to generate valid labels for your material.

Members are encouraged to use up the expired material in their projects to prevent the rack from overflowing. Please don't simply re-label the expired material without immediately using it because that's hoarding and doesn't help clear out the rack.

No storage is allowed outside the rack or intruding into the walkway. These materials will be thrown out.

Since this policy is unofficial, your material's safety is not guaranteed.
