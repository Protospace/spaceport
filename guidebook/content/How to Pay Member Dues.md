There are several ways to pay your member dues. The best way is to log into the Portal > Member > [Paymaster](https://my.protospace.ca/paymaster) and scroll down to the "Member Dues".

## Payment Methods 

Here are the various ways you can pay your member dues. We recommend the first one since all other methods require manual recording by a volunteer.

Member dues are $55 / month for regular members, and $35 / month for subsidized members. If you forget which rate you are on, scroll down to the "Details" section of the Portal's [home page](https://my.protospace.ca/).

### Online with Credit / Debit

As mentioned above, go to the [Paymaster](https://my.protospace.ca/paymaster) section of the Portal. Click a yellow button to pay for a month once, subscribe for monthly payments, or pay for an entire year (and get one month for free). If you pay using these buttons, your payment will be recognized and applied to your account almost instantly.

We use PayPal here to process the credit card and debit card transactions. If you have an issue with your PayPal account click the "Pay with Debit or Credit Card" button below to try check out as a guest. You may need to use an alternative email so it doesn't get linked to your broken PayPal account.

I want to re-iterate the importance of trying to make PayPal work since the transactions are processed automatically. All other types of transactions require manual entry by a Protospace Director. Doing that monthly for hundreds of members really adds up!

### Online with Interac e-Transfer

Send an e-Transfer to `info@protospace.ca` for the amount of months of member dues you with to pay for. If your bank account's name doesn't match your portal account's name or you are paying for someone else, include an explanation in the memo.

Next send an email to <directors@protospace.ca> to let them know your payment needs to be manually processed.

### In Person with Credit Card

Find someone at Protospace who knows how to use the Square card reader terminal and tap your card to pay. You can email <directors@protospace.ca> to arrange a time to meet someone, or come to a [[Tuesday Open House]] and you'll probably find someone there.

Next send an email to <directors@protospace.ca> to let them know your payment needs to be manually processed.

### In Person with Cash / Cheque

Find a Director at Protospace as they are able to accept cash and cheques and generate a receipt for it. You can email <directors@protospace.ca> to arrange a time. They will also be able to process your transaction and apply it to your account.
