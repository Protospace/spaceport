New members don't have 24/7 access to Protospace until they are [[Vetting|vetted]]. This page explains some ways you can visit Protospace while you are a probationary member.

If you need access to the building during one of the following events, ring the doorbell and wait for someone to answer. Machines can be loud, so if no one answers after 30 seconds, ring it again. Repeat until someone lets you in. You might need to prove that you are a member by giving your name.
