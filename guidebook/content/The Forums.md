The forums, also known as "Spacebar" is the primary way Protospace members communicate.

It's similar to a message board. Not to be confused with [[The Portal]] (aka Spaceport).

You can log in with your [[Protospace Account]].

The forums are divided into two main sections, General Discussion and Administrivia. General Discussion is publicly available while Administrivia is restricted to active Protospace members only. The Administrivia section should be used for any business related to Protospace and topics we don't want the whole Internet to have access to.

The forums are powered by the open-source software Discourse (not to be confused with Discord).
