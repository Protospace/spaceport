## Reimbursement Procedure

1. Submit your request for reimbursement electronically to "<payme@protospace.ca>".
2. Your request should include:
    - What you bought, why you bought it.
    - Your name if you use an alias or non-obvious email.
    - A receipt, statement or similar documentation
    - How you want to be paid
3. Large amounts or unexplained items may require time for the directors to discuss or bring to a meeting. Routine items, expected items, and items already approved by motion will just be paid.
4. If you owe money to Protospace (behind on dues, unpaid course, et cetera), you will not be paid until your negative balance is cleared.
