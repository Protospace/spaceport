Protospace routinely has two types of meetings: Monthly members' meetings, and the annual general meeting (AGM).

If you can't make it in-person, you are encouraged to join remotely at:

You may also [[Proxy Voting|assign a proxy]] to someone so they can vote on your behalf.

## Monthly Members' Meetings

Also known as the "members' meetings", these happen on two dates:

- the 3rd Wednesday of the month on even months
- the 3rd Thursday of the month on odd months

The meeting starts at 7:03 PM Alberta time. You can check the Portal > Home > Stats section for the date of the next member meeting or check the class schedule.

There is usually no monthly members' meeting in December.

### Meeting Structure

The meeting minutes will be recorded by the volunteer minute taker and posted to the [[The Forums|forums]] after.

Attendance is taken for those present at the meeting. A quorum of 11 total members is required for the meeting to start. Any members looking to be [[Vetting|vetted]] can do that next. Previous meeting minutes, Protospace finances, and member counts will be reviewed.

The meeting agenda will be gone through and any new business will be addressed. [[Pitches and Motions|Motions]] will be presented and discussed, then a vote will be held.

The next monthly members' meeting date and next [[Monthly Clean]] date will be determined. Finally there will be a motion to adjourn and the meeting will end.

### Voting

A motion requires 75% of the votes to be in favour to pass (not including abstentions). For example, if:

- 14 people vote YES,
- 4 people vote NO,
- and 6 people abstain,

the motion would pass since 18 people voted and 14 / 18 = 77.7%. Had one abstention instead voted no, the motion would fail since 19 people would have voted and 14 / 19 = 73.6%, which is under the 75% threshold. The number of abstentions has no impact on the result of the vote.

## Annual General Meeting

The annual general meeting (AGM) occurs once per year, usually in the spring or summer on a Saturday. It must occur within 16 months of the previous AGM. The time and date will be determined at a monthly members' meeting.

The AGM is when we elect new [[Directors]].

### Meeting Structure

The AGM is similar to a monthly members' meeting with a few differences:

- the financial review looks at the entire year
- the Directors present a report of what happened in the past year
- thank-yous are given to members
- all Directors automatically resign, and the next Directors are elected via a ballot vote
- two special motions required by law are copy-pasted from the last year's minutes and voted on
