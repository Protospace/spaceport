Active vetted Protospace members can have a personal shelf where they can store their own materials and supplies.

Unfortunately there are only ~230 shelves for 500+ members, so not everyone can have one. Shelves are claimed on a first-come, first-served basis as they become available.

## How to claim an empty shelf

1. Be an active, vetted Protospace member current on your dues
2. Find an empty shelf without a name label
3. Verify the shelf doesn't have an owner on the Portal > Space > [Storage](https://my.protospace.ca/storage) list
4. Label the shelf with your **name and contact info**
5. Claim the shelf here: <https://my.protospace.ca/claimshelf>

Tip: You can filter for empty shelves on the Portal > Space > [Storage](https://my.protospace.ca/storage) page.

## How to take over an expired shelf

Shelves can be taken over 180 days after their owner's membership has expired.

If the shelf isn't empty, you're responsible for making a documented effort to contact the previous owner and return their things to them.

1. Be an active, vetted Protospace member current on your dues
2. Find a shelf belonging to an expired Protospace member
3. Open the specific shelf's page from the Portal > Space > [Storage](https://my.protospace.ca/storage) list
4. If it says "Shelf can be taken over now.", click the link and claim the shelf
5. Remove the previous owner's name and contact info
6. Label the shelf with your **name and contact info**
7. If the shelf isn't empty, contact the previous owner via the contact info. Tell them to collect their items off the expired shelf (during an open house or arrange a different time). Ask the [[Directors]] if you need help contacting them. Don't throw their stuff away until you've made a reasonable, documented effort to return their property.

Tip: You can filter for expired shelves on the Portal > Space > [Storage](https://my.protospace.ca/storage) page. The list will be sorted by longest expired first.
