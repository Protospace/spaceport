There are two main ways of making changes to Protospace.

Unofficially with [[Do-ocracy]]:

- great for small changes and improvements
- more efficient due to lack of bureaucracy
- can make the change immediately
- some risk of having your changes reverted

Officially using [[Pitches and Motions]]:

- better for large changes
- required for policy changes, acquiring new tools, or spending money
- less efficient because there's potential for bureaucracy
- you might need to wait 48h - 30 days to get approval
- less risk of having your changes reverted
