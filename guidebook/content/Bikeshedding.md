Bikeshedding is when people spend disproportionate time discussing trivial details. It comes from the idea that it's easier to have an opinion on simple things like the colour of a bike shed than on complex technical or strategic topics.

This often results in a never-ending discussion on the [[The Forums|forums]] and can cause people to abandon ideas or projects.

To avoid bikeshedding you might be able to simply execute your idea using [[Do-ocracy]], instead of posting about it. This eliminates any potential for bikeshedding to occur.

One egregious example of it happening that stands out in the Author's mind is in this thread about putting up window signs:  
<https://forum.protospace.ca/t/front-window-posters/3532>

This thread attracted 205 posts (second highest of all time) with all kinds of discussion including what the signs should say, the colour, materials, flag poles, **3D simulations of how they would look**, and bylaws that didn't even apply. However, it didn't result in any signs actually being put up. Instead window signs simply could have been made and put up in an hour. Then if anyone didn't like them, taken down.
