Protospace has an open house every Tuesday evening from 7 pm to 9 pm (even holidays).

The public is welcome to come hang out, get tours, and see our cool projects!

Probationary members often get [[Vetting|vetted]] during the open house.

## Welcoming Guests

The front door remains unlocked during the open house. Please welcome everyone that walks in and ask if it's their first time at Protospace. If it is, have them read and sign the welcome sheet clip-board with their name and date.

Next invite them to print a name tag using Protovac, the old terminal computer on the island.

Try to arrange for the guest to have a tour with other guests. If there isn't enough people to make a tour group, have them hang out and introduce them to the rest of the members in the welcome room while they wait. Some questions you may want to ask are:

- How did you hear about Protospace?
- What kind of things do you want to make?
- What kind of tools do you want to use?
- What projects do you have on the go?

## Tours

Once a group has formed looking for a tour, a Protospace member is welcome to show them around. Bring the group to all areas of the space and explain what some of the tools and machines are. Answer any questions they may have and end the tour back in the welcome room, giving guests the option of [[Signing Up]].

Don't pressure anyone to sign up. We aren't that desperate for members, and the best members are the ones who are keen to join.

If you want to learn how to give a tour, ask a member who gives tours.

## Food

During the summer, someone will usually BBQ some food once vetting is over (BBQ o'Clock). This is entirely member run, bought and paid for by the member organizing it. It usually costs between $2 - $20 to participate. If you would like to cook food for people, make an announcement on the forums several days before the open house.

During the winter, several of us go to Beckham's Pub down the street once vetting is over (Bar o'Clock). Someone will walk around asking "Bar? Bar? Bar?" and people will make their way over. We usually put some tables together and all are welcome.
