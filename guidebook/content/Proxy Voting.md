If you are unable to attend a [[Members' Meetings|meeting]] in-person or online, you can assign a proxy to someone so they can vote on your behalf.

Proxies must be assigned at least 48 hours before the meeting. Late proxies may be accepted by vote during the meeting.

Follow these steps:

- Contact your proxy voter and ask if they'll accept your proxy.
	- ask for their email address
	- tell them your voting preferences
- Email the [[Directors]] via <directors@protospace.ca> the following message:
```
To: directors@protospace.ca
CC: [your proxy voter's email]
Subject: Meeting Proxy

Dear Directors,

I'd like to assign my proxy to [proxy voter's name] for the upcoming [members' meeting | AGM].

Thanks,
[your full name]
```
- Monitor the upcoming meeting agenda when it's posted in the [meetings category](https://forum.protospace.ca/c/administrivia/meetings/45) to make sure your proxy vote was noted.

Note: your proxy holder will be able to vote however they wish on all motions.
