Members are welcome (and encouraged) to bring friends, family, and kids to Protospace.

Please make sure they read and sign the waiver in the welcome room. You can also make them a nametag on Protovac if you want.

Guests can help you with your project, but can't use any of the machinery since they aren't a member and haven't completed the [[New Member Orientation]]. They are also your responsibility while at the space. It's a good idea to give them a quick walk through of the space for safety.

Dogs are also welcome as long as they are well-behaved and don't make a mess.
