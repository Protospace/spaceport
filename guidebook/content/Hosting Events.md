Protospace members are welcome to host special events at the space for other members or the public.

To host an event, check that there aren't any other events or classes that will interfere on the [class schedule](https://my.protospace.ca/classes) (press Sort by Date). Classes take precedent over events. Make sure your event doesn't overlap with a [[Tuesday Open House]] evening, [[Monthly Clean]], or [[Members' Meetings|Members' Meeting]].

Next post about the event on the [[The Forums|forums]] to make sure no one objects. Ideally post 72 hours before it starts.

Give your guests instructions on how to get to Protospace and enter the building. They might need to ring the doorbell to get in, so be at the space early ready to answer the door.

Keep in mind that Protospace is a shared workshop / creative space, so members might be in other parts of the building making noise and dust. If this is a problem, host your event at a public library instead. Members might even attend your event if they see it happening.

If your event is targeted to non-members, consider contributing something back to Protospace in exchange for hosting your event. Tell them about Protospace in case they want to join!
