Hi [name],

Your Protospace member dues are behind by two months and you are now "overdue".

You are paid up until [date]. Please pay your dues to prevent having your

You can log into the portal and pay here:

Or send e-Transfer to info@protospace.ca or hand a director cash.

If there has been an error or you want to reply to this email, please click
